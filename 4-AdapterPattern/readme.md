### Adapter Pattern

```
The adapter pattern is a structural design pattern. It allows 2 or more incompatible objects to interface with each other.
Adapter also helps us to maintain the open/closed principle in our apps which means our code should be open to extension but closed for modifications because we don't know the implications of the modifications.
The adapter design pattern will help you fit the needs of two parts of code that are incompatible.
Adapter Pattern provides the functionality to use the old existing code as it is with the new features.
This way, its scope will be more encapsulated and more maintainable in the future.
