### Builder Design Pattern
``` 
The builder design pattern is a creational design pattern.
It is used when creation of product involves multiple independent steps.
A good example is Subway.
In the subway we choose bread then we choose we want cheese or not then we choose the toppings and finally the sauces.
```

```
Lets assume we have two subways one is vegie delight and other is chicken Teriyaki. And each have a builder associated with it.
